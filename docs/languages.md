## Language support

J!TrackGallery currently supports the following languages:
   - English
   - French
   - German
   - Polish
   - Spanish (partial)

If you are interested in adding another language, please contact the authors via the [issues page](https://github.com/mastervanleeuwen/J-TrackGallery/issues).

The language/translation files are located here in the [source tree](https://github.com/mastervanleeuwen/J-TrackGallery/tree/master/components/com_jtg/language) 
(and in a [different location for administrator interface](https://github.com/mastervanleeuwen/J-TrackGallery/tree/master/administrator/components/com_jtg/language)).
