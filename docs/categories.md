J!TrackGallery offers the possibility to organise tracks in _Categeries_, which are fully configurable. After installation, the suggesties categories are different activities, such as biking, hiking and driving, but you can completely customise the categories to suit your needs, for using different regions or other track atributes. Each category has an icon attached which is used on the overview map.

If you only need one category, you can switch off the use of categories in the configuration menu. Internally, the tracks are still categorised, but this not explicitly shown in the frontend to reduce complexity for the user. Track icons on the overview map are stil determined by the categories. All new tracks will be assigned to the default category.


## Category view

A view showing a map and/or list of tracks in a specific category
- Overview map
- Track search/filter box
- Track list
Each element can be switched on or off in the configuration menu.
The selection of columns shown in the track table is similar to that in the main 'Track list' overview page; it can also be configured in the configuration menu.
