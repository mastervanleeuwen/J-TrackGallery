### J!TrackGallery

J!TrackGallery is a Joomla Track Gallery component, which allows to store and display GPS track data and photos.

Our Goal is to provide a non commercial, free, open source, GNU/GPL2 licensed component for Joomla 3.x and 4.x (with some backward compatibility for older Joomla versions). 

The main features are:
- Upload and edit GPS tracks (GPX tracks/routes, KML, TCX format) via frontend or backend (administrator view)
- Support for different maps: Open Street Map + variants (e.g. opencylcemap), Bing maps, and French IGN
- Basic features for each track are calculated from the GPS track
- Add a description, category information etc
- Add photos to each track; geotagged images are shown on the map
- Frontend provides functionality for rating and commenting
- Appearance can be tweaked via css templates (partial support)

### History of J!TrackGallery  

This is a continuation of the J!TrackGallery project that has been developed by Christophe Seguinot who also maintained a home/commmunity page at http://jtrackgallery.net which is no longer available.
J!TrackGallery may be considered as a fork of [InJooosm](http://injooosm.sourceforge.net/)
This valuable component is no longer maintained (last version is for Joomla 1.5). At the beginning of this project, I was not able to reach previous author so I decided to rename the component from InJooOSM to J!TrackGallery. 

It may be note that **InJooosm** was a fork of [joomgpstracks](http://www.joomlaos.de/Joomla_CMS_Downloads/Joomla_Komponenten/JoomGPSTracks.html)

 - Many Thanks to *Michael Pfister* (JoomGPSTracks) and *Christian Knorr* (InJooOSM) for providing this valuable component to the Open source community. 

N.B. For those who always use InJooosm 0.5.7, see manual: http://jtrackgallery.net/wiki/install/migrate-from-injoosm
