### J!TrackGallery

J!TrackGallery is a Joomla GPS Track Gallery component.  
Our Goal is to provide a non commercial, free, open source, GNU/GPL3 licensed component for Joomla 4.x and Joomla 3.x (with some backward compatibility), which allows
 to seamlessly upload GPX tracks and display maps and tracks on Joomla based website.
- J!Track Gallery documentation: https://mastervanleeuwen.github.io/J-TrackGallery/ and [release notes](https://mastervanleeuwen.github.io/J-TrackGallery/releasenotes)
- For bug reports and enhancement requests, please use the [github issues page](https://github.com/mastervanleeuwen/J-TrackGallery/issues)

#### Technical notes

J!TrackGallery uses:
- OpenLayers for maps and GPS track drawing
- Highslide to display (geotagged) photos
- The 'gd' PHP package to perform image operations like thumbnail creation for photos

#### History of J!TrackGallery  

The original versions of J!TrackGallery were written by Christoph Seguinot and published on the jtrackgallery.net website. The website recently disappeared; new versions are hosted on Github.
J!TrackGallery may be considered as a fork of [InJooosm](http://injooosm.sourceforge.net/)
This valuable component is no longer maintained (last version is for Joomla 1.5). At the beginning of this project, I was not able to reach previous author so I decided to rename the component from InJooOSM to J!TrackGallery. 

It may be note that **InJooosm** was a fork of [joomgpstracks](http://www.joomlaos.de/Joomla_CMS_Downloads/Joomla_Komponenten/JoomGPSTracks.html)

 - Many Thanks to *Michael Pfister* (JoomGPSTracks) and *Christian Knorr* (InJooOSM) for providing this valuable component to the Open source community. 

N.B. For those who always use InJooosm 0.5.7, see manual: http://jtrackgallery.net/wiki/install/migrate-from-injoosm
